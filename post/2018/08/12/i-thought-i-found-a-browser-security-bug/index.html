<p>A few weeks ago I thought I&rsquo;d stumbled across something really bad when just casually browsing the web. It all started on a financial information website, upon clicking a link, the page partially loaded some of its content, then, without warning, redirected the browser to a completely different domain with some weird spam/search engine content on it, <a href="https://dyn.com/blog/ne-body-out-there/">from a known domain squatter</a>.</p>

<p><em>Strange&hellip;</em></p>

<p>After refreshing a few times, it was still doing it. Oddly, this behaviour seemed to only appear in Firefox; Chrome and Safari did not exhibit the same. This was a Firefox thing, I was sure of it!</p>

<p>After digging into the source of the affected website, it became apparent that something seemed off with this <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag for flash content:</p>

<figure>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">embed</span> 
  <span style="color:#4070a0">id</span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;button&#34;</span> 
  <span style="color:#4070a0">src</span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;http://&lt;squatters-domain&gt;/zclip/js/ZeroClipboard.swf&#34;</span> 
  <span style="color:#4070a0">type</span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34;</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">embed</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<figcaption>Always host your own</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They had hardcoded a URL to a SWF file on a domain since taken over by a squatter. A quick look on <a href="https://archive.org">waybackmachine</a> suggested the previous owner was a developer hosting some code they had written, but had since let the domain expire.</p>

<p>So instead, the browser gets whatever is now being served. This is bad in itself because they could craft a malicious SWF file to do nefarious things if they were really inclined.</p>

<p>However, even if they did return a SWF file, it didn&rsquo;t explain why the redirect  was occurring, because I don&rsquo;t have Flash installed on my computer.</p>

<h3 id="flash-or-no-flash">Flash or no flash</h3>

<p>This is where I begun to think this was a security issue, because the response for the &lsquo;swf&rsquo; request was HTML with some javascript in it, with the smoking gun being right here:</p>

<figure>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">if</span> (top.location <span style="color:#666">!=</span> location){
  top.location.href <span style="color:#666">=</span> location.protocol <span style="color:#666">+</span> <span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;//&#34;</span> 
                        <span style="color:#666">+</span> location.host 
                        <span style="color:#666">+</span> location.pathname;
}
</code></pre></div>
<figcaption>Get the browser to it!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Setting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/top">top.location.href</a> was causing the redirect to happen.</p>

<p><em>So wait a minute, the affected website had an <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag in it, expecting some flash content, but got served some HTML+Javascript instead, which it embedded and executed? That seemed weird fallback behaviour to me.</em></p>

<p>I raised this on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1473833">bugzilla</a> because at the time my initial thought was this was only affecting Firefox.</p>

<p>After writing a small application to mimic the issue, the browsers behaved differently when it came to setting the <code>type</code> to <code>application/x-shockwave-flash</code><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome displayed a &ldquo;click here to run flash&rdquo; placeholder

<ul>
<li>After enabling flash, it did not embed the response (i.e. it did nothing)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Firefox embedded the response so executed the javascript</li>
<li>Safari displayed a &ldquo;Missing Plug-in&rdquo; placeholder</li>
</ul>

<figure>
    <img style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;display:block" src="/img/safari-missing.png" title="Safari" />
    <img style="width:250px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;display:block" src="/img/chrome-placeholder.png" title="Chrome" />
<figcaption style="margin-top:1.0rem">Examples of the placeholders in Safari/Chrome</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After further investigation it turns out the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; can be replicated in Chrome too, using other MIME types like <code>type=&quot;video/webm&quot;</code>. In this particular case the behaviour changed slightly</p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome embedded the response so executed the javascript</li>
<li>Firefox embedded the response so executed the javascript</li>
<li>Safari displayed a &ldquo;Missing Plug-in&rdquo; placeholder</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried this with a few different MIME types and got differing results. You can see this in action on this <a href="https://staging.public.djharper.co.uk/demos/embed-issue/demo">demo page I built</a>. Try it out on different browsers to see how they behave. Note if you have Flash or Quicktime installed, then you will see different results.</p>

<h3 id="embed-ain-t-so-simple">Embed ain&rsquo;t so simple</h3>

<p>One of the purposes of the <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag is to allow third party plug-ins such as Flash or Quicktime to be embedded into a page, but as these have fallen out of favour over the years it appears the general advice is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/embed">&ldquo;don&rsquo;t use it&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Keep in mind that most modern browsers have deprecated and removed support for browser plug-ins, so relying upon <embed> is generally not wise if you want your site to be operable on the average user&rsquo;s browser</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, clearly the browsers seem to behave differently with the <code>type</code> attribute, and how they handle the response. While Safari seems to be staunchly against doing anything without a plugin installed for the <code>type</code>, Firefox and Chrome are a bit more of a mixed bag.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1473833">firefox bug</a> engendered some really interesting discussion, and their engineers <a href="https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D2542">implemented a patch</a> to change this behaviour in Firefox, <em>possibly</em> scheduled for version 63! They also <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3876">raised a spec bug on the HTML standards github</a> around this to get some clarity on this issue. I thought that was really cool!</p>

<p>On the Chrome side of things, I <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=860782#c2">filed a similar report</a>, but they closed it, saying it was a larger problem with the web in general. Very polite and curt response, but fair enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You are correct that there can be a vector for crypto-miners, or possibly deceptive messaging to a user, but that is a larger problem on the web. When content is loaded there are signals as to what type of content it is, but we don&rsquo;t constrain it based the the extension of the resource file (i.e. &lsquo;.webm&rsquo;).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the financial website? I eventually got a contact in their information security department and filed the issue with them. They&rsquo;ve since fixed it by removing the hardcoded dependency on that domain and are hosting the SWF file themselves.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-a-security-bug">Is it a security bug?</h3>

<p>I started out this journey just bumbling around on the web, and ended up encountering some behaviour that didn&rsquo;t seem right.</p>

<p>But after thinking about it, I&rsquo;m in two minds.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag is doing its job, embedding stuff. The question is, if you specify the <code>type</code> attribute with a valid MIME type, <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3876">what should the browser do</a>, and what should the fallback case be if the requested plugin cannot be handled or is missing?</p>

<p>You could argue that this is a non-issue that just stems from questionable coding practises, especially around hardcoding dependencies to third party sites that you cannot trust.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> However there is a bit of me that wonders if there are dark corners of websites out there that are embedding video<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> or flash content from domains that have since changed owners, or started returning dodgy responses.</p>

<p>Clearly the domain squatter is setting <code>top.location.href</code> for a reason, which makes me think they already know about this behaviour and are using it as a way to drive the browser into redirecting to their content. Other nefarious actors could use this &lsquo;feature&rsquo; to silently embed cryptominers, or craft redirects to phishing websites, but it&rsquo;s quite an involved process that relies on the &lsquo;victims&rsquo; website embedding content from elsewhere, so probably not a high risk.</p>

<p>It was an interesting ride anyway.</p>
